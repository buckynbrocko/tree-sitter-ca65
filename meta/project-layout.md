# Project Layout

- 📁 `bindings` - parser language bindings
- 📁 `corpus` - tests
- 📁 `etc` - would have been `src`, but tree-sitter already co-opted the directory name
- 📁 `meta` - usage & project documentation
- 📁 `misc` - mostly optional files used for trying ideas (not commited)
- 📁 `queries` - tree-sitter highlights and queries
- 📁 `scripts` - anything too long for the makefile
- 📁 `src` - managed by tree-sitter, contains
